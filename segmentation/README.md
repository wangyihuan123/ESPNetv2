#  ESPNetv2: A Light-weight, Power Efficient, and General Purpose Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains the source code that we used for semantic segmentation in our paper of our paper, [ESPNetv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11431).

***Note:*** New segmentation models for the PASCAL VOC and the Cityscapes are coming soon. Our new models achieves mIOU of [68.0](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/anonymous/DAMVRR.html) and [66.15](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/anonymous-results/?id=2267c613d55dd75d5301850c913b1507bf2f10586ca73eb8ebcf357cdcf3e036) on the PASCAL VOC and the Cityscapes test sets, respectively. 


## Training and Evaluation on the Cityscapes dataset

Below are the commands to train and test the network at scale `s=1.0`.

### Training

You can train the network with and without pre-trained weights on the ImageNet dataset using following commands:

 * Without pre-trained weights
``` 
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python main.py --batch_size 10 --s 1.0
```

 * With pre-trained weights
``` 
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python main.py --batch_size 10 --s 1.0 --pretrained ../imagenet/pretrained_weights/espnetv2_s_1.0.pth
```

### Evaluation
To evaluate our pre-trained models (or the ones trained by you), you can use `gen_cityscapes.py` file.

Use below command to evaluate the performance of our model at scale `s=1.0` on the Cityscapes dataset.
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python gen_cityscapes.py --s 1.0 --pretrained ./pretrained_models/espnetv2_segmentation_s_1.0.pth
```

## Performance on the Cityscapes dataset

Our model is 2% accurate than the [ESPNet](https://github.com/sacmehta/ESPNet) while being much more efficient. See more details in the paper.
